## Welcome to Spring Integration Scala DSL Samples

This project's goal is to help you to quickly get started with _**Spring Integration Scala DSL**_.
It could also be used as a template for starting new projects in the future. The sample project 
contains many small samples demonstrating many supported EIP pattern configuration as well as a more 
complete sample (i.e., Order Processing) demonstrating what a real application might look like. The small 
samples organized as JUnit test and are all run during the build process while Order Processing is a Scala 
application which you'll be able to execute separately. 

For more details on how to check-out, build and import the project into your favorite IDE please follow
